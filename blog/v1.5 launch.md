We are thrilled to announce the release of [Dojo v1.5](https://dojo.compasslabs.ai/)!
Dojo is an end-to-end DeFi research platform designed to **test**, **train**, and **optimize** of DeFi strategies and smart contracts at the **EVM smart contract level**. Dojo is accessible as a Python interface on your local infrastructure. With this new version, we introduce exciting features and resolved bugs to provide an even more robust and user-friendly experience. Let's dive into the details of the latest updates:

* **Visualisation:** Real-Time Simulation Insights
  
One of the standout features of dojo v1.5 is the **interactive simulation dashboard**. Now, users can visualize their simulation runs, monitor performance metrics, track agent actions, and stay updated on real-time simulation progress. 

* **Flexible Data Loaders:** Adaptability for Any Environment
  
Dojo includes pre-implemented data loaders for integrated protocols, but we understand that users may want to run simulations on environments for which dojo does not have native data support. In response to this, dojo v1.5 introduces **flexible data loaders**. Users can now implement their own data loaders to read in protocol events data specific to their desired environment. Dojo ensures data integrity by performing checks to validate the format and type of the provided data.

In addition to the new features, our development team has dedicated effort to resolving bugs in the previous version of dojo to enhance the stability of the platform.
