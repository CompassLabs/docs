Today we are happy to launch dojo: an end-to-end DeFi research platform, enabling **testing**, **training** and **optimizing** DeFi strategies and smart contracts at the EVM smart contract level. Accessible as a Python interface on your local infrastructure. Designed to scale research and productionisation of DeFi strategies!


<!--truncate-->
* **Data Sourcing:** Utilize dojo's on- and off-chain data capabilities for data ingestion and strategy evaluation

* **Simulation:** Test, train and optimize DeFi strategies and smart contracts through dojo's agent-based simulator to simulate transactions at the EVM smart contract level

* **Analysis:** Gain insights into strategy performance through tailored agent metric tracking implementation

# How it works

Our platform implements an **agent-environment loop** that combines principles from reinforcement learning and agent-based modelling for ultra-realistic and risk-free visibility into smart contract interactions and flow of funds. This flexible framework enables you to **simulate**, **train** and **optimize** a diverse range of scenarios that reflect DeFi dynamics at the **smart contract level**.

# Benefits

* **Decrease the sim2real gap:** Dojo runs at the smart contract level and forks the actual blockchain to guarantee on-chain protocol logic 

* **Implement customized strategies:** Dojoâ€™s flexible pythonic interface enables users to implement custom-made policies for agents to adopt

* **Run on local infrastructure:** Rest assured your strategies and experimentation are kept solely on your local infrastructure

# Future plans
Today, dojo is in beta testing. Short term, we are developing the following features:

* **Market impact models:** explore complex scenarios and understand effects of market dynamics on your strategy through inclusion of comprehensive market impact models

* **MEV models:** simulate block inclusion probability and transaction ordering and gain insight into the implications of MEV

* **Multi-protocol and multi-chain simulations:** conduct simulations across multiple protocols and chains simultaneously

Driven by a team of engineers and academics working at the forefront of machine learning and decentralized finance, our long-term vision for Dojo is to become a robust DeFi research and optimization platform for all kinds of applications. Our goal is to provide the much-needed reliability to help investors and DeFi markets to flourish.

_Dojo is derived from the Japanese words representing immersive learning, and we believe that our solution captures the essence of this concept._
