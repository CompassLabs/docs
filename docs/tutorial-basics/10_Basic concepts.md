# Basic concepts

A quick overview of how Dojo works.


## Local simulation environment
Dojo aims to simulate your trading strategys as realisticly as possible, minimizing the [simulation gap](https://www.TODO.com).  
Dojo creates forks of the actual blockchain. Simulations are run on the fork and all simulated trades are submitted to it.  
This means that e.g. simulated UniswapV3 transactions are executed by the actual Uniswap contract code. We can thus capture effects such as TODO and TODO.

## Agent based model
Dojo is written as an [agent based framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model).  
You can have multiple agents following multiple different strategys at any given time.
