# Getting Started

Let's discover **dojo in 3 simple steps**.

### Licensing

You will need a license key, to run dojo.
To learn more abouyt plans and pricing click [here](https://www.TODO.com).

However, to get started, you can generate a **[trial license](https://www.TODO.com)**.  
The trial license comes with limitations and is only valid for one week on one machine, but it should be enough to get you excited about dojo.ðŸ¥³

### Prerequisites
There's a few more things you need to set up for dojo. If you've done some coding in web3 before, chances are you're good to go already!

1. RPC Node provider
Setup and account with one of the provider, such as [Infura](https://www.infura.io/). You'll need the RPC_URL it provides. e.g. `https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/ac8ee<...>961`
2. A local ethereum development environment. We suggest Hardhat.
  `npm install --save-dev hardhat`

### Start using dojo

#### 1. Install dojo
dojo is provided as a Python package on Pypi.
To install, simply run  
```python3 -m pip install -i http://54.90.104.158:8080 dojo --trusted-host 54.90.104.158```


#### 2. Setup dojo configuration
Create a `.env` file in your main directory.
```md title=".env" {1-4}
---
RPC_URL=<YOUR URL>
CHAIN=<chain> # one of ethereum, polygon
LICENSE_KEY=<YOUR LICENSE KEY>
---
```

#### Verify install
if everything is set up correctly, the following command should throw no erros.
```
 python -c "import dojo"
```
