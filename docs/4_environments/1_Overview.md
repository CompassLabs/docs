# Overview

Enviroments in `dojo` are reprensentations of different DeFi exchanges/protocols agents can interact with.
We currently support [UniswapV3](./UniswapV3) and are working hard to launch [BalancerV2](./BalancerV2) support soon.

## Purpose
Environments generally provide the following functionality: 
- Move the simulation forward in time to the next block at every simulation step
- Emit observations to provide the agent with the necessary information about the environment’s current state (based on the agent’s actions)
- Emit rewards generated by the agent to evaluate the agent’s actions
- Accept a list of actions and execute the action in the environment
Each environment module contains information on the observations, actions and environment object for that environment. For example, to get this information for UniswapV3: 

```python
from dojo.environments.uniswapV3 import UniV3Obs, UniV3Action, UniV3Env
```


<!-- Let’s go through a dojo use-case of a trader trading on a UniswapV3 pool, who wants to measure its wealth generated over time: 


At every block (= simulation step) Uniswap (=environment) emits protocol information such as the pool’s tokens, the pool’s trading fees and the pool’s token prices (= observations), as well as its wealth generated (=reward) by the trade (= action) to the trader (=agent). The trader’s strategy can process those observations and rewards to decide on what trade to make next. 


```python
from dojo.environments.uniswapV3 import UniV3Obs, UniV3Action, UniV3Env
``` -->

<!-- ## Market Impact

Market impact describes how your policy actions will affect the behaviour of the other agents in the simulation.  
For example, while you can backtest on historical trade data, if you make significant actions on the exchange during the simulation, the market would likely have reacted to your actions.  

Each environment in `dojo` allows you to select different market impact models for your simulation.  -->

:::info
We are working on incorporating market impact models. Right now the simulation replays the historic transcations on the exchange exactly.
