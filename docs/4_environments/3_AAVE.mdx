## üîé Observations

An observation refers to the information that the agent receives from the environment at every block.  
With AAAVE, the most interesting observation is probably a users [health factor](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters#health-factor).

The methods within `AaveV3Obs` can be found [here](https://readthedocs.compasslabs.ai/dojo.observations.html#dojo.observations.UniV3Obs).


## üï∫ Actions

Actions are the means through which the agent interacts with the environment to achieve goals.  

In general, there are 4 actions you can perform on the Uniswap V3 environment:

- **SUPPLY**: Supplying collateral.
- **BORROW**: Borrowing a token from the pool.
- **WITHDRAW**: Withdrawing collateral.
- **REPAY**: Repay borrowed token.
- **LIQUIDATION**: Execute a liquidation on a poistion that slipped below a health factor of 1.0.
