# UniswapV3
You can imort the UniswapV3 environment by 
```python

```

:::tip
It is recommended to read the [whitepaper](https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf) if the concept of an automated market maker or conecentrated liquidity is unclear.

If you want to do a simulation outside of these pools, you can implement your own dataloader [here](../Dataloaders)

## Observations

An observation refers to the information that the agent receives from the environment at every timestep.
Think of the current price, or the amount of liquidity in the pool.  
Since UniswapV3 is based on tick ranges, many observations are on a per tick basis.  

The methods within `UniV3Obs` can be found [here](https://readthedocs.compasslabs.ai/dojo.environments.html#dojo.environments.uniswapV3.UniV3Obs).


## Actions

Actions are the means through which the agent interacts with the environment to achieve investment goals.  
Depending on whether you are testing or training, through the learning process, the agent can refine the action
strategy and leverage feedback from the environment in the form of the reward to gradually improve decision-making.

In general, there are 3 actions you can perform on the Uniswap V3 environment:

- **TRADE**
  - Trading one token for another token, without changing your invested liquidity
- **QUOTE**
  - Either providing or taking liquidity out of the pool
- **COLLECT**
  - Collect LP fees from an LP position

Please refer to the [code reference](https://readthedocs.compasslabs.ai/dojo.environments.html#dojo.environments.uniswapV3.UniV3Action) for more details.
