# UniswapV3
You can import the UniswapV3 🦄🦄🦄 environment by running:
```python
from dojo.environments import UniV3Env
```

:::tip
It is recommended to read the [whitepaper](https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf) if the concept of an automated market maker or concentrated liquidity is unclear.

If you want to do a **simulation outside of these pools**, you can implement your own dataloader **[here](../Dataloaders)**.

## 🔎 Observations

An observation refers to the information that the agent receives from the environment at every block.
Think of the current price 💸, or the liquidity 💧 in the pool.

The methods within `UniV3Obs` can be found [here](https://readthedocs.compasslabs.ai/dojo.observations.html#dojo.observations.UniV3Obs).


## 🕺 Actions

Actions are the means through which the agent interacts with the environment to achieve goals.  

In general, there are 4 actions you can perform on the Uniswap V3 environment:

- **TRADE**: trading one token for another token, without changing your invested liquidity
- **QUOTE**: either providing or taking liquidity out of the pool
- **COLLECT**: collect LP fees from an LP position
- **SET FEE PROTOCOL**: set the protocol fee of a pool

Please refer to the [code reference](https://readthedocs.compasslabs.ai/dojo.actions.html) for more details.
