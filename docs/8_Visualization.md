# Visualization

## Dojo simulation dashboard



Dojo provides an interactive simulation dashboard to visualize your runs üëì.

You can launch the simulation dashboard with separate Python script like this:
<CodeBlock file="start_dashboard.py" snippet_name={"1"}/>

Note that in this case the dashboard has been launched on port `8051`. If you run multiple simulations at the same time, each dashboard must run on its own port.


Now, when you use one of our runners, specify the same port:
```python
sim_blocks, sim_rewards = backtest_run(env, [demo_policy], port=8051)
```

### Jupyter notebook support

The simulation dashboard works in jupyter as well.  

To launch within Jupyter, add `jupyter=True` to the arguments of `run_app`:
