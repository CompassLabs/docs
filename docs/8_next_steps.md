# Congratulations!

You've made it!  


If you liked the intro and want to play around with dojo, you can get a *free trial license* [here](mailto:elisabeth@compasslabs.ai?subject=Dojo%20trial%20license%20request&body=%3C%20Please%20let%20us%20know%20your%20name%20and%20the%20company%20you%20represent.%20We'll%20get%20back%20ASAP%20%3E).

As next steps we suggest

### Check out our example repository

We have a [repo with working examples](https://github.com/CompassLabs/dojo_examples). This includes
- **Multiple Demo Policies:** e.g. Moving Average or Passive concentraded liquidity
- **Different Agents:** e.g. an agent that tracks impermanent loss
- **Full simulation loop:** e.g. Stiching it all together. Run these demos to run simulations, track the data and plot the results.

### Implement your own policies

Try to implement your own policy and test the results.

:::info We are happy to help our early adopters!
If you struggle implementing your own policies, we would love to understand how to make it more easy. Please don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto::elisabeth@compasslabs.ai)!
